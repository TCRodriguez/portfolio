Design

I came across this yellow color online, and liked the shade and how it played with a dark font color.

I wanted to use a monospace font for the headers, and 'Lato' for the body text as I've been a fan of it
for quite some time.

I used a combination of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid for the layout.

Future features

I'm working on adding a typewriter animation for the 'hero' text using JS to get the actual
dynamic inputting of text as opposed to playing with 'hidden' and 'visible' attributes.

I'm also working on adding the backend to this page to allow me to add all of my writing work
(articles, short stories, screenplays, etc.). I'm going to use MongoDB, Node.js and Express to
set this all up.

I want this to be a full profile of me as an individual,and I know that this goes against the 'standard practice' of keeping your portfolio page very specific, which
I understand completely. That being said, like everyone else on this planet, I have a multitude within me,
and I want to share all of me.
